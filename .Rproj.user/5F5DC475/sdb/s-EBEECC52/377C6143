This as a \nsolution to more reliable estimates of the kriging variance also when the \nstationarity assumption has been violated. The method was applied by \nSkoien et al. (2008), who showed that it can have advantages for cases where the \nstationarity assumption behind kriging is violated.\n\nIf the number of observations is high, it is recommended have \\code{nmax} lower.\nThis is partly because the method relies on positive kriging weights. The method\nto do this adds the norm of the largest negative weight to all weights, and rescales.\nThis tends to smooth the weights, giving a prediction closer to the average if a \ntoo large number of observation locations is used.\n}\n\n\\references{\nSkoien, J.
